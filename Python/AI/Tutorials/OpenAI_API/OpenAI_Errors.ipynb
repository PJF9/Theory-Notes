        "\n",
        "All errors live in `openai.error`\n",
        "\n",
        "* `APIError`: An **APIError** indicates that something went wrong on our side when processing your request. If this errror occurs then:\n",
        "    * Wait a few seconds and retry your request. Sometimes, the issue may be resolved quickly and your request may succeed on the second attempt.\n",
        "    * Check our status page for any ongoing incidents or maintenance that may affect our services. If there is an active incident, please follow the updates and wait until it is resolved before retrying your request.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `Timeout`: A **Timeout** error indicates that your request took too long to complete and our server closed the connection. This could be due to a network issue, a heavy load on our services, or a complex request that requires more processing time. If this errror occurs then:\n",
        "    * Wait a few seconds and retry your request. Sometimes, the network congestion or the load on our services may be reduced and your request may succeed on the second attempt.\n",
        "    * Check your network settings and make sure you have a stable and fast internet connection. You may need to switch to a different network, use a wired connection, or reduce the number of devices or applications using your bandwidth.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `RateLimitError`: A **RateLimitError** indicates that you have hit your assigned rate limit. This means that you have sent too many tokens or requests in a given period of time, and our services have temporarily blocked you from sending more. If this error occurs then:\n",
        "    * Send fewer tokens or requests or slow down. You may need to reduce the frequency or volume of your requests, batch your tokens, or implement exponential backoff. You can read our Rate limit guide for more details.\n",
        "    * Wait until your rate limit resets (one minute) and retry your request. The error message should give you a sense of your usage rate and permitted usage.\n",
        "    * You can also check your API usage statistics from your account dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `APIConnectionError`: An **APIConnectionError** indicates that your request could not reach our servers or establish a secure connection. This could be due to a network issue, a proxy configuration, an SSL certificate, or a firewall rule. If this error occurs, then:\n",
        "    * Check your network settings and make sure you have a stable and fast internet connection. You may need to switch to a different network, use a wired connection, or reduce the number of devices or applications using your bandwidth.\n",
        "    * Check your proxy configuration and make sure it is compatible with our services. You may need to update your proxy settings, use a different proxy, or bypass the proxy altogether.\n",
        "    * Check your SSL certificates and make sure they are valid and up-to-date. You may need to install or renew your certificates, use a different certificate authority, or disable SSL verification.\n",
        "    * Check your firewall rules and make sure they are not blocking or filtering our services. You may need to modify your firewall settings.\n",
        "    * If appropriate, check that your container has the correct permissions to send and receive traffic.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `InvalidRequestError`: An **InvalidRequestError** indicates that your request was malformed or missing some required parameters, such as a token or an input. This could be due to a typo, a formatting error, or a logic error in your code. If this error occur, then:\n",
        "    * Read the error message carefully and identify the specific error made. The error message should advise you on what parameter was invalid or missing, and what value or format was expected.\n",
        "    * Check the API Reference for the specific API method you were calling and make sure you are sending valid and complete parameters. You may need to review the parameter names, types, values, and formats, and ensure they match the documentation.\n",
        "    * Check the encoding, format, or size of your request data and make sure they are compatible with our services. You may need to encode your data in UTF-8, format your data in JSON, or compress your data if it is too large.\n",
        "    * Test your request using a tool like Postman or curl and make sure it works as expected. You may need to debug your code and fix any errors or inconsistencies in your request logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* `AuthenticationError`: An `AuthenticationError` indicates that your API key or token was invalid, expired, or revoked. This could be due to a typo, a formatting error, or a security breach. If this error occur, then:\n",
        "    * Check your API key or token and make sure it is correct and active. You may need to generate a new key from the API Key dashboard, ensure there are no extra spaces or characters, or use a different key or token if you have multiple ones.\n",
        "    * Ensure that you have followed the correct formatting.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `ServiceUnavailableError`: A **ServiceUnavailableError** indicates that our servers are temporarily unable to handle your request. This could be due to a planned or unplanned maintenance, a system upgrade, or a server failure. These errors can also be returned during periods of high traffic. If this error occur,then:\n",
        "    * Wait a few minutes and retry your request. Sometimes, the issue may be resolved quickly and your request may succeed on the next attempt.\n",
        "    * Check our status page for any ongoing incidents or maintenance that may affect our services. If there is an active incident, please follow the updates and wait until it is resolved before retrying your request."
