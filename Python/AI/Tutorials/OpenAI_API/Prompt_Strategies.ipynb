        "[Justin Fineberg](https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1627307795774144513/photo/1) has come up with an interesting approach to communicating with ChatGPT. Similar to the first tip above, the AI is instructed to take on a specific role. This time, however, ChatGPT takes on the tedious task of generating the structure for further prompts. In other words, the chatbot asks itself the very questions it needs to answer in the next prompts. If ChatGPT writes the questions in the form of a numbered list, you can refer directly to the numbers.\n",
