# Whatever we need to place in the screen, we need first to define our main interface

    Button:
        text: "Hallo"
        size_hint: 0.5, 0.6 # Modifying the size of the button inside the layaout (.x is a persentage of x%)
                            #   first width and then height, default is 1, 1
        pos_hint: {"x": .25} # Changing the position of the button
    Button:
