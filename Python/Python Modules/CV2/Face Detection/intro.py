"""
Face Detection tells you if in an image exists a face, and face recogntion whose face it is.

So to detect or recognize faces we need a classifier.
OpenCV has some pretrained classifiers that we can user. One of them is the `Haarcascade`

So we need to download a classifier from `https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.x/data/haarcascades`

We'll use the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
