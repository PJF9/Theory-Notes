/*
	To create a base and an easy way for creating queries we need to be able to read them correctly
    This is the easiest process to do so:
    
    1) FROM     : Which tables are we using
    2) WHERE    : Which records are we going to be exluded from the tables
    3) GROUP BY : After which field we are going to group the data
    4) HAVING   : Which groups are we exclude from the final table
    5) SELECT   : Which fields are going to be appeared at the result
    6) ORDER BY : By which field we are going to sort the records
    7) LIMIT    : How many records we want to appear
