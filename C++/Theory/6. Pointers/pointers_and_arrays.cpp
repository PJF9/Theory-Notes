 * 
 * ? What is an array ?
 *  In a nutshell an array is a collection of data, data of the
 *  same data type. Its a sequencialy data structure, meanning
 *  that each element of the array is stored next to each other
 *  inside RAM.
 * 
 * ? How we can commit memory space dynamicly for arrays ?
 *  Fist we need to create the array pointer, a pointer that is
 *  going to point on the first element of the array.
 *
 *       data_type* pointer's_name = new data_type [size_of_array];
 * 
 *  'data_type' is the data type that we want the elements of the
 *  array to be and 'size_of_array' is the size that we want the
 *  array to have. 
 *  
 *  Because we create a pointer that is pointing on an array, after
 *  the work is done with the array we need to dismiss the memory
 *  that we have commited.
 * 
 *      delete [] pointer's_name;

/**
 * ? Can we implement a two dimention array using dynamic memory ?
 *  The answer is yes. First of all we need to understand what a
 *  2d array is. A 2d array is an array that each element is 
 *  actually an array. So in order to store a 2d array in heap
 *  we need to create a pointer that will show to the 2d array and
 *  then we have to create a new pointer array for each element of
 *  the array. After we have created succesfully our array and we
 *  end with the work we needed it for, its time to 'delete' the
 *  memory space of the array. First we need to delete each element
 *  array and finally the 2d pointer array.
 *  
 *      data_type** 2d_pointer's_name = new data_type* [rows];
 *      
 *      for (int i=0; i<rows; i++) {
 *             2d_pointer's_name[i] = new data_type [columns];
 *      }
 *      
 *      ...
 * 
 *      for (int i=0; i<rows; i++) {
 *          delete [] 2d_pointer's_name[i]; 
 *      }
 *      
 *      delete [] 2d_pointer's_name;
