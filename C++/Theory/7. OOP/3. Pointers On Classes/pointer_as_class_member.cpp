     * ! The main problem of working with pointers and objects ( memory leak )
     * 
     * ? What this problem is about?
     *  The problem is occuring when we are using dynamic memory commitment and we are 
     *  trying to delete copied objects
     * 
     * ? Why copying object challenge an error?
     *  It's because when we creating the first object, the constructor provide him a 
     *  memory location at the heap and then with the accessors we assigne a value at this 
     *  memory location. 
     * 
     *  By declaring the second object, the constructor is commiting a new memory space at the heap
     *  for the second object. With the line "ob2 = ob1", we are pointing the ob2 to memory location 
     *  off ob1 ( and his value will be also the same as ob1 ).
     * 
     * After all the code is done and its time to run the destuctors, the first time the compiler 
     * deletes the ob2 ( dismiss its memory location ), but when it tries to run the 
     * destructor for the ob1 the program will crash because there will be not a memory space left 
     * to delete
