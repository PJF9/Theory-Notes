/*
    ? What is class inheritance ? 
    It's the last big concept of OOP
    Inheritance is taking a class an add it to another one ( both members and methods )

    etc of inheritance in life
    A horse is an animal
    A dog is also an animal, but a bulldog is also a dog...

    Syntax:
        class A: public B {
            ...
        };

        In this case all the public members and method of the B class are accessivle by the class A
        But the private ones are not accessable in the class A

        We can also instead of public ( public inheritance ) use private ( private inheritance )
