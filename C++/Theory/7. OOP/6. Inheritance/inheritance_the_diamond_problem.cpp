/*
    ? What is the diamond problem ?
    The diamond problem is the main problem with inheritance
    It's about some members
    Lets say we want to add the name of the philosopher king
    So we build a new class that will inherate by the philosopher king

    The problem is that the compiler don't know where the name is comming from
    ( The king class or the philosopher one? )

    First solutuon is to use the :: operator (King::name or Philosopher::name)
    This is not the best choice

    The best choice is to use virtual inheritance

    We have to create a default constructor because, each time the King constructor or the philosopher consructor
    is being run, before they run the person constructor must exetuted first, but with no given values
