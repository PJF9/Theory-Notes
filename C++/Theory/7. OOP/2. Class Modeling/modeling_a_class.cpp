/*
    ? What to model about?
    Modeling a class is the concept that creating the best object posible for that class

    This concept is very common when we are working with real life problems and we are trying to create classes to solve them
    
    * etc:
      Lets say that an appartment building has 3 floors. Every floor has 5 appartments. Every appartment has peoples...
