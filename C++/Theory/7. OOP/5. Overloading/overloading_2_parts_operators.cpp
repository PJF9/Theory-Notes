/*
    ? What is operators overloading?
    In c++ as in python ( with dunder methods ) we can overload the classic math operators
    to give a little more functionality to our class  

    ? How can we achieve the overloading in c++
        * + operator
        The + operator is consist by two part, the left one and the rigth one ( left + right )
        The + operator is called by the left part of the operation
        The right part is the argument in the function ( left.operator+(rigtht) )
        
        Syntax: class_name operator+(const class_name &right)

        ! The right object is being passt as a const to prevent its modification ( when we could use const only better will be to our program ) 
        ! Also we are passing the right object as a reference to prevent the compiler to create an copy of that object

        We can overload the + operator to add a const value with the object
        
        Syntax: class_name operator+(int right)

        * - operator
        The method is the same wil the + operator overloading

        Syntax: class_name operator-(const class_name &right)
    

    By this way we can overload every operator we wont, only if its consist 2 parts ( one left and one rigth )
    ! The left one must be always an object of that class
    ! But the right one can be whatever we want
