#include <iostream>

/*
    To overload the = operator first we need to understant it

    ? What does the = operator ?
    This operator is copy the result of the right side to the left ( a = b ) 

    The result of a = b is going to be a
    This helps us with multiple = ( a = b = c )

    ? How can we overload the = operator ?
    Syntax: class_name &operator=(const class_name &right)

    We use reference to prevent the compiler to copy the object
