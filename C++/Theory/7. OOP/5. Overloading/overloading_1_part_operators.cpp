#include <iostream>

/*
    To understand how we can overload this type off operator we need to incpect them
    lets take for example the ++ operator

    ? What is the ++ operator ?
    The ++ operator is the operator that increment by one the left variable ( x++ == x = x + 1 )
    First the x is going to be x and then the x is going to incremented by one

    ? What happens to this situation (a = x++) ?
    lets incpect it: a = x = x + 1
    So a will be equal to x and x is going to be equal x amd then the x is going to be equal to x + 1 

    Now we now how this operators work

    ? How can we overload the ++ operator ?
    Syntax: class_name operator++(int right)

    In this situation we dont care at all for the argument, we only want it to be int data type 

    ? What is going to do the a = ++x ?
    a = x + 1 = x
    So the a = x + 1 and the x = x + 1

    Suntax: class_name operator++()
