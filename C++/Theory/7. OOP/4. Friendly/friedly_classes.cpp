/*
    ? What is a frienly class
    At c++ we can create a class A that is a friendly class on another
    class B
    With this method the object of the A class have access to the private
    class members at the B class 

    class A {
        ...
    };

    class B {
        private:
            ...
        public:
            friend class A;
            ...
    }

    * In fact we are declaring in a class, other classes that can have access to it's private class members 

    We can't overuse the friecdly class in our progeamms
    If we do that is like all the class members are public

    Also the "friendship" has a directon
    In that example the class A is a friendly class to the B class
    Not the oposite
