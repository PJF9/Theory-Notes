/*
    Whether or not there are any @throws tags for specific exceptions, a function or 
    method should have an @exceptsafe tag. The description following the tag should 
    describe the level of exception safety provided by the function or method.

    The following terms may be used for brevity:

    no-throw
        The function is guaranteed to always return without throwing an exception.
    strong
        If the function throws an exception, the program will be in the same state 
        as before the call; i.e., failed calls have no side effects.
    basic
        If the function throws an exception, the program will be in a valid state, 
        but not necessarily a predictable one. No memory, file descriptors, locks, or 
        other resources will be leaked.
    none
        If the function throws an exception, objects may be corrupted and unsafe to use, 
        or resources may be leaked.
